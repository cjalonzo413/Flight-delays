# Flight-delays

One of my goals is to work for an airlines because I love traveling but I hate delays. Wouldn't it be cool to predict if a flight would be delayed or not? I took some categories from a dataset I thought were most interesting and made some visualizations and created a model to make a prediction.

This is my 2nd personal project and the first finished draft of it. There are still things I need to update on it like adding a couple other features, fine tuning my model, and trying other ML models.

I used the data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics: https://www.bts.gov/
